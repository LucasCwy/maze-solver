# Maze Solver

# Abstract
Maze Solver is a Java repository that provides efficient implementations of popular pathfinding algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* (A-Star). Designed to solve mazes of various sizes and complexities, this repository offers an intuitive and flexible solution for finding the shortest path through a maze. Whether you're interested in maze exploration, game development, or algorithmic problem-solving, MazeSolverAI provides an easy-to-use framework to navigate and discover optimal routes within mazes.
